# Exchange2010_hashes

A hash of all the files from exchange 2010 RTM and SP3 path: C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V14

There are also two dir /s *.aspx outputs from this path to show all the aspx files that exist by DEFAULT.

If you are hunting for threat actor artifacts then look for aspx files that aren't suposed to be there! (obviosly if you have third party of custome code of your own that makes this different).
